## Talk Description
The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MaltaMathSoc/" target="_blank">Malta Mathematical Society</a> organises monthly lectures open to the public to encourage research in mathematics both professionally and recreationally. In November 2020, I gave a short online talk on using Stirling's formula to estimate factorials of large numbers. This talk was part of an event of "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/767800073799736/" target="_blank">quick fire talks</a>", where the speakers would each talk for about 10â€“15 minutes about an accessible topic.
