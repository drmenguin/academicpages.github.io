## Talk Description
The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MaltaMathSoc/" target="_blank">Malta Mathematical Society</a> organises monthly lectures open to the public to encourage research in mathematics both professionally and recreationally. In December 2019, I gave a lecture on Church's $\lambda$-calculus. The $\lambda$-calculus is a very simple formal language which is expressive enough to serve as a foundation for mathematical logic. In the talk, I discussed what a formal language is, explored some of the history of mathematical logic and finally demonstrated how the lambda calculus can model various mathematical structures. The $\bf Y$ combinator was also mentioned briefly.
