<p>
    My name is Luke Collins. I graduated from the <a target="_blank" href="https://um.edu.mt">University of Malta</a> with a double honours in Mathematics and Computer Science (first class, <i>summa cum laude</i>), and I was a research assistant at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.um.edu.mt/science/maths">Department of Mathematics</a> there. I'm currently reading for a Master's degree in Mathematics at the <a target="_blank" href="">University of Warwick</a>. I'm also the cofounder of the mobile app company <a target="_blank" href="https://learnd.com.mt">LearnD</a>. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to classical music, playing the piano, and sometimes I tutor mathematics and computing to A-level and undergraduate students.

I am a member and supporter of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM">Free Software Foundation</a>, a movement which advocates for users' rights to study the source code of programs executing on their machine. I make use of Arch Linux, and always run free (libre) whenever possible.
