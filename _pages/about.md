<p>
    My name is Luke Collins. I am a fourth year maths and computer science student and research assistant at the <a href="https://um.edu.mt">University of Malta</a>, and the cofounder of the mobile app company <a href="https://learnd.com.mt">LearnD</a>. I enjoy listening to classical music and playing the piano. I also tutor mathematics and computing to A-level and undergraduate students.
