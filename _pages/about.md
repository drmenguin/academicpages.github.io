    My name is Luke Collins. I am a fourth year maths and computer science student and research assistant at the <a target="_blank" href="https://um.edu.mt">University of Malta</a>, and the cofounder of the mobile app company <a target="_blank" href="https://learnd.com.mt">LearnD</a>. I enjoy listening to classical music and playing the piano. I also tutor mathematics and computing to A-level and undergraduate students.

I am a member and supporter of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM">Free Software Foundation</a>, a movement which advocates for users' rights to study the source code of programs executing on their machine. I make use of Arch Linux, and always run free (libre) whenever possible.
