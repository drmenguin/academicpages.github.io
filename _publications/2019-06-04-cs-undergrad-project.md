## Abstract
<p>In this project, we consider a subset $\text{sHML}$ of formul&aelig; in the Hennessy-Milner Logic with recursion ($\mu\text{HML}$) which are enforceable through suppressions. A synthesis function is introduced, which converts safety properties in $\text{sHML}$ to suppression enforcers through a formula normalisation process. This synthesis function assumes that different branches in the input formula are disjoint, and that every variable is guarded by modal necessity&mdash;such formul&aelig; are said to be in normal form. It turns out that this restriction of input formul&aelig; is only superficial: an algorithm which converts any given formula in $\text{sHML}$ to an equivalent formula in normal form is implemented in the form of a Haskell program.</p>
